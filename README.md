# parts-library

This is a KiCad parts library containing all the custom schematic components and PCB footprints used during the course of this project. The components in the library are detailed below.

## Light Sensors

The light sensors used on the light sensor board and their associated footprints are included:

* BH1750 ([Datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1813320.pdf?_ga=2.138993524.699683899.1527583637-63322148.1527583637))
* VEML6030 ([Datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2118174.pdf?_ga=2.138993524.699683899.1527583637-63322148.1527583637))

## Motor Drivers/Half Bridges

The chips used to drive the solenoid in our solenoid valves are given, alongside their associated footprints:

* L298P w/ PowerSO-20 Footprint ([Datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1693054.pdf?_ga=2.65007976.699683899.1527583637-63322148.1527583637))
* LMD18201T w/ TO-220-11 Footprint ([Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=LMD18201&&fileType=pdf))

## Voltage Regulators

The XP Power switching voltage regulators used are included, along with their surface mount and through-hole footprints:

* TR Series ([Datasheet](https://docs-emea.rs-online.com/webdocs/150c/0900766b8150c31a.pdf))
* STR Series ([Datasheet](https://docs-emea.rs-online.com/webdocs/150c/0900766b8150c4bd.pdf))

## I2C Repeaters

A schematic component for the I2C repeater (PCA9517) used on the control board is also included, though the footprint (TSSOP-8) is standard so did not need to be reproduced:

* PCA9517A ([Datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2058493.pdf?_ga=2.72750036.699683899.1527583637-63322148.1527583637))
